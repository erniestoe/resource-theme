# OpenResource 
Small open source Wordpress theme created for sharing community resources (or whatever really...)
Theme in action (demo site): https://forsythcommunityresources.com/

## Requirements
- Wordpress
- ACF (Advanced Custom Fields free version)

## Getting started
1. Download resource-site-2025 and starter-content.xml from https://github.com/erniestoe/resource-theme/releases
2. Upload the resource-site-2025.zip to your wordpress site and activate the theme
3. Install the ACF plugin (free version)
4. Import starter-content.xml under Tools > Import to add sample pages and menus (you may need to install the WordPress importer if prompted).

### ACF setup:
After activating the theme, go to Custom Fields in your WordPress admin. You’ll see a notice to sync available field groups — click "Sync" to load the theme's ACF data into your site.

## Wordpress note
Once theme is activated and ACF json is synced in order to get things looking like the demo site you'll need to set the homepage to Home (settings > reading > set homepage to static page). You'll also need to go into appearance > menus and make sure the site menu box is checked (for My Site Menu)
